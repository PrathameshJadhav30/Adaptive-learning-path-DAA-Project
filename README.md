# Adaptive-learning-path-DAA-Project
The Adaptive Learning Path project is a Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) implementation in C++. The goal is to generate personalized learning paths for students based on their strengths, weaknesses, and learning objectives using various algorithms such as:

- Graph-based algorithms (Shortest Path: Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall)
- Dynamic Programming for knowledge progression
- Greedy Algorithms for optimizing topic selection
This project efficiently adapts to the student's performance to recommend an optimal sequence of topics for learning.

# Features
- Personalized learning paths for students
- Implementation of graph and optimization algorithms
- Efficient topic recommendation using Dijkstra and Greedy methods
- Dynamic Programming to analyze knowledge progression

# Dependencies
- C++11 or above: Ensure compatibility with modern C++ features.
- Standard Template Library (STL): Used for graphs, priority queues, and data handling.

# Algorithm Details
- Graph-Based Algorithms:

Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm: Calculates the shortest path between topics based on difficulty weights.
Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: Finds all pairs' shortest paths for optimized recommendations.
- Dynamic Programming (DP):

Tracks a student's learning progression and identifies the next best topic to focus on.
Ensures the most optimal learning path is created based on prerequisites.
- Greedy Algorithms:

Selects topics with the least difficulty and highest benefit first to speed up learning.
